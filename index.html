<p class="intro">Welcome to the official route to becoming a Marketing Major at the University of Georgia! I am currently a first year student in Athens, and wanted to construct a cite to not only keep me on track over the years, but also to benefit future intended marketing majors who may not know where to start course wise.  I am someone who loves to be organized so having my credits already achieved from high school, current courses, and a link to the CRNs of courses I need to take to graduate will be an efficient resource to go back and forth as I register for classes each semester. I hope if you are visiting this website you find it useful for pre and post Terry.</p>
